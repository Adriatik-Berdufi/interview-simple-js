Steps:

- install [node js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- run `npm install`
- run the `helloWorld.js` script to test the node installation
- follow the exercises in the `exercises` directory

Recommended:

- use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE (edit files, run scripts)
- use git to fork the repository and push exercise solutions (at least one commit per exercise). Each script should be in the respective exercise directory
