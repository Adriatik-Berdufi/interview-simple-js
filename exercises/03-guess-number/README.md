Create a node.js program that:

1. Generates a random number between 1 and 10.
2. Asks the user to guess the number.
3. If the user guesses correctly, it displays a "Congratulations!" message.
4. If the guess is wrong, it tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low and allows them to try again.
5. Limit the number of guesses to 3.
