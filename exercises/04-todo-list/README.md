Create a basic To-Do list where the user can:

- Add tasks.
- View the list of tasks.
- Remove a task by entering its position in the list.

The program asks the user what to do (e.g. 1 -> add task, 2 -> remove task) and asks the user more questions accordingly. The to-do list is stored in memory.
Tasks do **not** have a done/undone state, and are represented as a list of strings
